## Background
Here I've downloaded methylation profiling data (Illumina Infinium) from GEO, dataset can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63409). This study took bone marrow samples from 5 healthy patients, and blood samples from 15 patients with blood cancer.

For the healthy, the authors sorted out hematopoeietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (LMPP, MPP, etc) based on external markers with FACS.
For the leukemia patients, the authors sorted out putative leukemia stem cells (LSCs, CD34+CD38-), and blasts (CD34-), and other (CD34+CD38+) based on CD34 and CD38 expression with FACS.

My project found that a single genetic mutation in Tet2 dramatically changes leukemia blasts to act more like leukemia stem cells. I was curious if my cells' methylation profiles were more similar to explicitly profiled LSCs following the Tet2 mutation.

Prior to what you see here, I used the ChAMP library to normalize the methylation data (quantile-based), and made a table of metadata.

## PCA of all samples 
For a nice overview of all samples, I start with PCA and color points based on cell type. Qualitatively, the normal cells (red-green) are already separate from the leukemic cells (pink/purple). However, the cell types are intermixed in this projection.
```{r}
# set seed
set.seed(1)

# find top 10,000 most variable CpGs, subset bvals
bvals_summary = data.frame(mean=rowMeans(bvals),
                           stdev=rowSds(as.matrix(bvals)))
bvals_summary = bvals_summary[order(bvals_summary$stdev, decreasing=T),]
bvals_small = bvals[rownames(bvals_summary[1:10000,]),]

# find top 3 PCs with PCA of smaller dataset (~8s)
num_dimensions_PCA = 3
bVal_PCA = PCA(t(bvals_small), ncp=num_dimensions_PCA, scale.unit=T, graph=F)

# get transformed coords, and add metadata for simpler ggplot visualization
plot_PCA = as.data.frame(bVal_PCA$ind$coord)
names(plot_PCA) <- paste0("PC", 1:num_dimensions_PCA)
plot_PCA$dataset <- pheno$dataset
plot_PCA$cell.type <- pheno$cell.type

# scatterplot of PC1 v PC2 colored by cell type
ggplot(plot_PCA, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=cell.type)) +
  geom_point() + theme_classic() +
  scale_color_manual(values=pal) + labs(color="Cell type")

```


## Heatmap of leukemia cells
Ultimately, I want to know if my cells with a Tet2 mutation are more LSC-like or not. So, from this dataset, I want to know methylation features make a cell an LSC.
However, hierarchical clustering of the leukemia cells in this dataset show that differences between patients are larger than differences between cell type, making it difficult to initially understand what makes LSCs different.
```{r}
# sample 1000 CpGs to plot in heatmap
bvals_heatmap = bvals_small[sample(1:nrow(bvals_small), 1000), ]

# how do patient cancer samples cluster
# AKA is it easy to find out what separates cancer stem cells from proliferative cancer cells?
leuk_samples = pheno$cell.type %in% c("CD34-", "CD34+38+", "CD34+38-")
leuk_cluster_data = t(bvals_heatmap[,leuk_samples])
leuk_cluster_pheno = pheno[leuk_samples,]
leuk_clusters <- as.dendrogram(stats::hclust(dist(leuk_cluster_data, method="manhattan"), method="complete"))

In normal cells, too, cells from the same patient are qualitatively more similar to each other than cells of the same type across patients. Although, hierarchical clustering shows patients are
